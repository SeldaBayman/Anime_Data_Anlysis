Details about the dataset
Welcome to the Anime Data Analysis Project! In this project, we're going to dive into the exciting world of anime using the popular data analysis library (Pandas).

We have a dataset containing information about various anime shows. This information includes details like the title, genres, popularity, release date, and more. Our goal is to make you familiar with filtering, querying and sorting on anime dataset using pandas.

This project is perfect for beginners who are interested in practicing the above-mentioned skills using .loc[], .iloc[], .query(), .sort_values() functions using pandas library. Whether you're an anime fan curious about the data behind your favorite shows or a beginner in data analysis looking for a fun project, you're in the right place!, Without any further delay Let's get started!

NOTE:

In the Release_Year column, 0 represents the missing value.

When we display the resulting dataframe, we might only show a part of it with an image, saying 'This is how your result will look.' This is because if the dataframe is long, it is not possible for us to show the entire dataframe.

Note: This project was solved at DataWars!:) I solve all of these questions no looking at solving codes!:)
