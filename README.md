Anime Data Filtering and Sorting with ,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn

Details about the dataset
Welcome to the Anime Data Analysis Project! In this project, we're going to dive into the exciting world of anime using the popular data analysis library (Pandas).

We have a dataset containing information about various anime shows. This information includes details like the title, genres, popularity, release date, and more. Our goal is to make you familiar with filtering, querying and sorting on anime dataset using pandas.

This project is perfect for beginners who are interested in practicing the above-mentioned skills using .loc[], .iloc[], .query(), .sort_values() functions using pandas library. Whether you're an anime fan curious about the data behind your favorite shows or a beginner in data analysis looking for a fun project, you're in the right place!, Without any further delay Let's get started!

Details about the dataset
Title: This contains the titles of different anime.
Genres: This column lists the genres or categories to which each anime belongs.
Rank: This column indicates the rank of each anime based on some criteria such as user ratings, popularity, or critical acclaim.
Popularity: This column represents the popularity of each anime. Popularity could be measured by factors such as online searches, views, ratings, or social media mentions.
Score: This column indicates the overall score or rating of each anime. Scores are often based on user reviews, ratings, or aggregated scores from various sources.
Episodes: This column denotes the number of episodes available for each anime.
Episode_Length(In min): This column specifies the length of each episode in terms of minutes.
Release Date: This column represents the release date of each anime.
Release_Year: This column represents the year in which the anime is released.

NOTE:

In the Release_Year column, 0 represents the missing value.

When we display the resulting dataframe, we might only show a part of it with an image, saying 'This is how your result will look.' This is because if the dataframe is long, it is not possible for us to show the entire dataframe.

Note: This project was solved at DataWars!:) I solve all of these questions no looking at solving codes!:)
